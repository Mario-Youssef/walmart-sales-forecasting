# 🛒 Walmart Sales Forecasting

This project applies time series forecasting on Walmart's weekly sales data using SARIMA and LSTM models.

## 📈 Objectives
- Analyze historical sales data for Store 1, Dept 1
- Perform stationarity checks with ADF
- Compare SARIMA and LSTM forecasting
- Evaluate results using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Apply DTW-based clustering for department segmentation

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- ADF Stationarity Test
- Time Series Decomposition
- Autocorrelation & PACF
- Clustering with DTW
- Evaluation using MSE

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, scikit-learn, tslearn

## 📁 Project Files
- `Final_Project_Code.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full workflow
- `train.csv`, `features.csv`, `stores.csv`: Original Walmart dataset (optional)

## 📌 Summary
The LSTM model outperformed traditional SARIMA and SARIMAX in terms of forecasting accuracy.  
Clustering provided insight into department similarity across time.
